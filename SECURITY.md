## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Bonfire, **please do not open a public issue**. Instead, report it privately by emailing us at [security@bonfire.cafe] or via [Signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKIEyk2qBsrjxX0Bv9v6NpOj1aDBOousFNLTfmqMfSMLDlEhC5NpbKvlW4Bb69vHlD40Nu).

- Please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue.
- If possible, include steps to reproduce, potential impact, and suggestions for remediation.
- If the issue affects other fediverse projects, please mention them. We are happy to coordinate with other teams for coordinated disclosure.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us a reasonable amount of time to respond and fix the vulnerability before any public disclosure.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue to the project maintainers.

We aim to respond within 5 working days and will keep you updated on our progress.

## Security Best Practices

- Always run the latest supported version.
- Keep your server software and dependencies up to date.
- Review our docs for secure configuration tips.

## Public Security Announcements

When a vulnerability is fixed, we will publish a security advisory on the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/bonfire-networks/bonfire-app/security/advisories) page and announce it on our project website and fediverse account [@bonfire@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@bonfire).

## Credits

We thank all security researchers and contributors for helping make Bonfire safer for everyone in the fediverse.
