## Bonfire

An app for [Bonfire](https://bonfire.cafe/) that bundles the following extensions:

- [Bonfire:Common](https://github.com/bonfire-ecosystem/bonfire_common) - common utils
- [Bonfire:Me](https://github.com/bonfire-ecosystem/bonfire_me) - user profiles
- More to come...


## Handy commands

* `mix cpub.deps.update` - updates commonspub dep versions
* `mix cpub.deps.clean` - cleans the compiled deps so config is reread
* `mix cpub.deps` - both of the above

If using Docker, just replace `mix ` with `make mix-` in the above commands, so for example `mix cpub.deps` becomes `make mix-cpub.deps`.
