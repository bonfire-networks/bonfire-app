# Bonfire 

[Bonfire](https://bonfirenetworks.org/) - a place your community is happy to call home.

Self-host your online community and shape your experience at the most granular level: add and remove features, change behaviours and appearance, tune, swap or turn off algorithms. You are in total control.

Empower your community with tools to perform social, economic and political activities. Create safe and private spaces, and connect with the fediverse on your own terms.
