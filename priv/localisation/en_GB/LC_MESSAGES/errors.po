#  `msgid`s here are often extracted from source code.
#  Add new translations manually only if they're dynamic
#  translations that can't be statically extracted.

#  Run `mix gettext.extract` to bring this file up to
#  date. Leave `msgstr`s empty as changing them here has no
#  effect: edit them in PO (`.po`) files instead.
