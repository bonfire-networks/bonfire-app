#  This file is a PO Template file.

#  "msgid"s here are often extracted from source code.
#  Add new messages manually only if they're dynamic
#  messages that can't be statically extracted.
# 
#  Run "mix gettext.extract" to bring this file up to
#  date. Leave "msgstr"s empty as changing them here has no
#  effect: edit them in PO (.po) files instead.
