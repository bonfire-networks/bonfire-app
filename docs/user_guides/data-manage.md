## Moving your information

Bonfire provides comprehensive data portability - you can export and import your data at any time to maintain full control over your digital life.

### Exporting your data

For detailed information about what you can export and how to do it, see [Moving away from your Bonfire instance: Available exports](instance-emigration.md#available-exports).

### Importing data

For detailed information about what you can import and how the import system works, see [Moving to a Bonfire instance: Importing data](instance-immigration.md#importing-data).

## Deleting your data

### Important considerations

- **Irreversible action** - Cannot be undone
- **Profile and posts/activities data is permanently removed**
- **Username becomes permanently unavailable** - No one can use your old username again
- **Federation limitations** - While Bonfire notifies other servers to delete your data, some copies may remain on remote servers

### Before deleting

Consider these alternatives:
1. [Export your data](#moving-your-information) for backup
2. Delete specific posts or activities
3. [Redirect your profile](#profile-redirect) instead of deleting
4. [Move your account](#profile-move) to a different instance

### Deleting your profile

Profile deletion can be found at the bottom of **Settings > Profile**.

Deleting your user profile will remove all associated data from this server. This includes all posts, comments, and any other data associated with this user profile. It will also send requests to delete your data to other fediverse servers.

### Deleting your account

Account deletion can be found at the bottom of **Settings > Account**.

Deleting your account will delete all your user profiles, and remove all your data from this server. This includes all your posts, comments, and any other data associated with your account.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I recover my account after deletion?

No, account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Your username will also be permanently unavailable.

### What happens to my data on other servers?

Bonfire sends deletion notices to other fediverse servers, but cannot guarantee compliance due to technical limitations, unreachable servers, or non-compliance.

### How often can I request an archive?

You can request a full archive of your posts and media once every 7 days.

### Can I import data from other platforms?

You can import compatible CSV exports from Bonfire and other fediverse platforms like Mastodon for supported data types.

*From compatible platforms (Bonfire, Mastodon, etc.):*
- **Circles/Lists** - Custom groups become Bonfire circles
- **Likes and Boosts** - Re-apply your past interactions
- **Complete post history** - Your entire posting history with preserved dates and URLs

### Will importing old posts spam my followers?

No - imported posts are preserved with their original identity and then boosted to your timeline, but these boosts don't notify your current followers. They appear in your profile but don't flood anyone's timeline.

### Where can I get help?

If you need assistance, contact your instance administrator or visit the Bonfire community channels.
