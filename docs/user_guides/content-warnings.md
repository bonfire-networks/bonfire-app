# Sensitive Content & Content Warnings

Bonfire gives you tools to share responsibly and help others control their experience.

## Content Warnings (CW)

- When composing a post, you can add a **Content Warning** (CW) to hide the main content behind a summary or warning label.
- Use CWs for topics that might be sensitive, triggering, or simply off-topic for some audiences (e.g. politics, spoilers, personal news).
- Readers must click to reveal the hidden content.

## Marking Media as Sensitive

- When attaching images, videos, or files, you can mark them as **Sensitive**.
- Sensitive media is blurred or hidden by default until viewers choose to reveal it.
- Use this for graphic, explicit, or potentially disturbing content.

## Viewing Content Warnings and Sensitive Media

- By default, Bonfire hides content warnings and sensitive media.

## Tips for Respectful Sharing

- Use content warnings and sensitivity flags thoughtfully to help others control their experience.
- If in doubt, err on the side of adding a CW and/or marking media as sensitive.
- Respect the boundaries and expectations of your circles, communities, and instance.
