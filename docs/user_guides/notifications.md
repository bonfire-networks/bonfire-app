# Notifications

Bonfire keeps you up to date with activity relevant to you—such as new followers, mentions, replies, boosts, and more.

## Types of Notifications

- **Follows:** When someone follows one of your profiles.
- **Requests:** When someone requests to follow a private profile.
- **Mentions:** When someone mentions you in a post (such as in a reply to your post).
- **Boosts:** When someone boosts (shares) your post.
- **Likes:** When someone likes your post.
- **Other:** Depending on enabled extensions, you may receive notifications for events, polls, group activity, etc.

## Viewing and Filtering Notifications

- Access notifications from the bell icon or the **Notifications** link in the navigation bar.
- Filter notifications by type (e.g. only mentions, only follows), by source (remote/local), or by time period.
- Sort notifications chronologically or by type.

## Managing Notifications

- Click on a notification to view more details or interact (e.g. follow back, reply).
- Use the filter and sort options at the top to focus on what matters most.
- Mark notifications as read or clear them as needed (with the button at the top right).

## Notification Preferences

- Adjust which notifications you receive (and how) in your account settings.
<!-- 
- You can silence notifications from specific users or circles.

## Tips

- Use filters to avoid notification overload.
- Review your notification settings to match your preferences.
- Notifications are separate for each of your profiles—switch profiles to see activity relevant to each.
