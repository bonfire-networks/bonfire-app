# Getting Started: Signing Up and Profiles

Welcome to Bonfire! This guide will help you create your account, set up your profiles, and get comfortable with the basics.

## 1. Signing Up

- Visit the Bonfire instance you want to join (e.g. `https://yourinstance.tld`). Some instances are invite-only, and you may need an invite link from an admin or existing member.
- Click **Sign Up** and fill in your desired username, email, and password.
- Check your email for a confirmation link.

## 2. Creating and Managing Profiles

After signing up, you can create multiple profiles under your account. For example:
- A personal profile for friends and family
- A work profile for professional contacts
- A project or community profile (which you can share with collaborators)

To create or manage profiles:
- Go to your account settings and select **Profiles**.
- Click **Create Profile** to add a new one.
- Set a username, display name, and bio 
- Choose privacy settings for each profile:
    - **People need to make a request before they can follow me:** When enabled, others must send a follow request that you approve before they can follow this profile.
    - **Make my profile publicly discoverable:** When enabled, your profile can be found in Bonfire directories, the fediverse, and search engines.
    - **Make my content searchable:** When enabled, your posts and content can be indexed and found via search in Bonfire, the fediverse, and search engines.
- Switch between profiles as needed when posting or interacting.

> **Note:** By default, your different profiles are not publicly linked—each appears as a separate identity.  
> For more details, see [Your Bonfire Profile and Identity](./your-profile.md#multiple-profiles-per-account).

- Add a display name and avatar to help others recognize you.
- Write a short bio to introduce yourself.
