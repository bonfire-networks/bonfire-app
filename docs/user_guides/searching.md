# Search 

Bonfire provides powerful search and discovery tools to help you find people, posts, and communities—both locally and across the fediverse.

## Using Search

- Access the search bar from the top of the sidebar or navigation.
- Enter a keyword or phrase, a hashtag or username, or a full fediverse address or URL (e.g. `@alex@bonfire.community.social`).
- Filter results by **All types**, **Users**, or **Posts**.
- Switch between **Public only** and **Private** (e.g. DMs or custom boundaries) tabs to control the scope of your search.

## What Can You Search?

- **Users:** Find people by username, display name, or address—on your instance or across the fediverse.
- **Posts:** Search for public posts containing your keywords.
<!-- 
- **Groups/Circles:** Discover shared circles and communities (see [Circles as Shared Lists](./shared-circles.md)). 
-->

## Tips for Effective Search

- Use the full address (e.g. `@user@instance.tld` or the URL) to find remote users or posts.
- Use keywords or hashtags to find relevant posts and discussions.
- Use the "Private" tab to search your own DMs and posts with custom boundaries (only visible to you or circles you are in).
