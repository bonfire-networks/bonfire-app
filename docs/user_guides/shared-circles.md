# Using Circles as Shared Lists

Bonfire circles are flexible tools for organizing people, sharing content, and curating custom feeds (see [Circles & Boundaries](/docs/user_guides/boundaries.md#circles) for a detailed explanation). Circles can be private or shared, and are a powerful way to collaborate and discover new content.

## What is a Shared Circle?

A shared circle is a group you manage together with others. Members see the circle's feed, browse the member list, and—if allowed—add or remove people. Shared circles show posts and activities from their members, and can include anyone from across the fediverse.

## Managing Members

View the member list at any time, and use **Follow all members** to quickly follow everyone. If you have permission, add or remove members using the search bar or member list—keeping the group relevant and up to date.

## Using Circles as Lists

Circles are ideal for organizing friends, collaborators, or interest groups. You can use them to filter your sidebar feeds and notifications, or include them in [custom feeds](./custom-feeds.md) for more focused browsing. Sharing a circle lets others see the feed and follow its members.

## Tips

While circles help keep your feed focused and relevant, combining circles with boundaries gives you fine-grained privacy and sharing controls (see [Circles & Boundaries](/docs/user_guides/boundaries.md)).
