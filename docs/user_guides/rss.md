# RSS Feeds

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a well-established standard for sharing content on the web. You might recognize the orange RSS logo from news sites and blogs.

## What is RSS?

RSS lets people subscribe to updates from your Bonfire profile using any RSS reader, even if they donâ€™t have a Fediverse account. This is especially useful for longer-form, blog-style posts or for sharing updates with a wider audience.

## Enabling RSS for Your Profile

You (or anyone) can use an RSS reader to subscribe to feeds and receive updates whenever you post.

## Which Posts Are Shared via RSS?

- **Only your Public posts** are included in your profile RSS feed.
- Private posts and other activities are not included.
- The RSS feed shows the same posts that are visible when you open your profile in a browser.

## Feed Presets and RSS

You can also follow RSS feeds for certain feed presets (such as "Local", "Public", or custom public circles).  
Feeds that require authentication or contain private content (like your "Following" feed) are not available via RSS.

## Where to Find RSS Feeds

You can access RSS feeds 

- On profiles: Get the RSS or Atom feed for all public posts by that user from the three-dot menu. Select **Subscribe to feed (RSS/Atom)** to copy the feed link or open it in your RSS reader.
- For feed preset, click the gear icon next to "Feeds" in the sidebar, find the public feed preset you want (e.g. Local, Events, Articles), and click the RSS/Atom icon.

## Tips

- Each public post also has its own RSS feed for comments and replies, so readers can follow discussions on individual threads.
- Use RSS to share your public updates with people outside the Fediverse, or to follow your feeds from you favourite feed reader app.
- Great for blog-style posts or for reaching readers who prefer RSS.
