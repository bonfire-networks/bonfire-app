# Running Your Own Instance

## Why Run Your Own Bonfire Instance?

Running your own Bonfire instance gives you full control over your digital space and how you connect to the fediverse. It is the best way to shape your online experience and contribute to a healthier, more diverse fediverse!

### Benefits

- **Autonomy:** Set your own rules, moderation policies, and community guidelines.
- **Privacy:** Decide how data is stored, who can join, and what features are enabled.
- **Customization:** Enable or disable Bonfire extensions, adjust boundaries, and tailor the experience for your community’s needs.
- **Resilience:** Your instance is independent—no single company or admin can take it away.
- **Community Building:** Create a space for your friends, organization, or interest group, with unique culture and governance.

## Who is it for?

- Individuals who want a personal, independent presence.
- Groups, collectives, or organizations who want to host their own community.
