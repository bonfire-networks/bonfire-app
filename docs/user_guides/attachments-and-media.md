# Attachments and Media

Depending on how your instance was configured, you can share more than just text—add images, videos, audio, and files to your posts to enrich your conversations and collaborations.

## Attaching Media to Posts

- When composing a post, click the **Attach** or **Media** button to add files.
- Supported types may include images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP), videos (MP4, WebM), audio files (MP3, OGG), and documents.
- You can attach multiple files to a single post (subject to instance limits).
- The maximum file size for uploads is set by your instance admin (often 40MB per file).

## Image Descriptions (Alt Text)

When you attach media, you can add a description (alt text) for each image or video.  
Alt text is essential for accessibility, especially for blind or partially-sighted users.  
A good image description helps everyone understand the context and content of your media.

> *Image descriptions are a gesture of care and an essential part of accessibility. By writing them, you support cross-disability solidarity.*

## Metadata and Privacy

Photos and videos often contain Exif metadata, which may include camera details, timestamps, and location information.  

- To protect your privacy, consider disabling location tagging (geotagging) in your camera app.
- Before uploading media, use external tools to strip Exif data if needed.
- Even with metadata removed, be mindful that media content itself can reveal information about your location or circumstances.

## Media Privacy and Boundaries

- Media attachments follow the same privacy and boundary settings as your post.
- You can choose who can view or interact with your media by selecting the appropriate audience (public, circles, boundaries, or specific people).

## Marking Media as Sensitive

- If your media contains sensitive or potentially disturbing content, mark it as sensitive when uploading.
- Marked media will be blurred or hidden by default until viewers choose to reveal it.
- For more, see [Sensitive Content & Content Warnings](./content-warnings.md).

## Editing and Describing Media

- Add or edit descriptions (alt text) before posting.
- You can remove attachments before posting if needed.

## Tips

- Use media to make your posts more engaging, informative, or fun.
- Check licensing and privacy requirements of the orignal author when sharing files.
- Indicate the license (e.g. Creative Commons BY-SA) of the content.
- Use content warnings and sensitivity flags thoughtfully.
- Be mindful of privacy risks when sharing media, especially if you are at risk of surveillance or stalking.
