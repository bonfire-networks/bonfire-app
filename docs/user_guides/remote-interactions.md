# Remote Interactions and the Fediverse

Bonfire is part of the fediverse—a network of independent platforms that communicate using open standards like ActivityPub.

## Interacting with Remote Users

You can follow, mention, and message people on other Bonfire instances or compatible platforms (like Mastodon, PeerTube, etc.).

- To follow someone from another instance, copy their full address (e.g. `@alex@bonfire.community.social`) and search for it on your own instance.
- Remote posts and profiles appear in your feeds just like local ones, depending on your privacy and boundary settings.

## Interacting from Remote Sites

When browsing a remote site powered by an ActivityPub platform (such as Bonfire, Mastodon, etc), clicking on any interaction button (e.g. Follow, Reply, Boost) will usually open a dialog that lets you enter your Bonfire address. You will then be redirected to your local Bonfire instance to complete the action.

**Example:**  
If you find a profile or post on another Mastodon site, click "Follow" and enter your Bonfire address (e.g. `@yourname@yourinstance.tld`). You’ll be redirected to your Bonfire instance to confirm the follow.

This works for replies, boosts, and other interactions as well.

## Sharing and Messaging

- You can reply to, boost, or share posts from remote users, as long as their privacy settings allow it.
- Direct messages may work across the fediverse if the remote platform supports ActivityPub DMs.

## Tips

- Use full addresses to find and follow remote users.
- Some features may work differently or be limited when interacting with other platforms.
- Respect boundaries and privacy settings—remote users may have different defaults.
