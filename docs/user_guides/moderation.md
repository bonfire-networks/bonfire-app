# Blocking & Moderation Tools

Bonfire provides flexible tools to help you manage your experience, protect your boundaries, and keep your community safe.

## Flagging or Hiding Posts

- **Flag:** Report a post to moderators for review. You should explain what boundaries were broken and what action you request.
- **Hide:** Remove a post from your feed. You can still view it via direct link. 

## Blocking: Silencing & Ghosting

- **Silence:** Hides all content from a user in your feeds. You won't see their posts, mentions, or messages, but you can still view their profile via direct link. 
- **Ghost:** Prevents a user or instance from seeing or interacting with you or your content. They won't see your private posts, can't follow you, and you can't mention or message them. 
- **Block:** Combines both silence and ghostâ€”when you block someone, you both stop seeing each other's content and interactions. 

You can manage your block, silence, and ghost lists from the **Safety** section in the sidebar.

## Importing Block Lists

Bonfire lets you import blocklists from trusted sources to silence or ghost multiple users or instances at once.

- Go to **Import block lists** under Safety.
- Choose a source (e.g. Garden Fence, Seirdy's lists, Fediseer).
- Select import type and upload the CSV file.
- Review and confirm the import.

## Moderator and Admin Powers

- Instance admins can block, silence, or ghost users for all local users.
- Moderators review flagged posts and take action as needed (such as talking to the participants to facilitate a resolution, or hiding or blocking and deleting content or profiles).

## Tips

- Use blocking, silencing, and ghosting to protect your boundaries and curate your experience.
- Import blocklists to benefit from community curation.
- Flag posts that break boundaries or codes of conduct for moderator review, and hide ones that you simply do not want to see.
