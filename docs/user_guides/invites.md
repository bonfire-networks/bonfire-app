# Invites

Bonfire uses an invite system to help communities grow intentionally and maintain safety.

## How Invites Work

- By default, new Bonfire instances are invite-only. Existing members or admins can generate invite links to share with others.
- Admins can enable public registration if desired, but many keep invites enabled for better moderation and onboarding.

## Sending Invites

- If you have permission, go to **Instance Settings** or your profile menu and select **Invites**.
- Click **Generate Invite Link** to create a new invite.
- Share the invite link with the person you want to join. They can use it to sign up for your instance.

## Managing Invites

- Admins can view, revoke, or limit invites from the **Invites** section.
- You can set how many times an invite can be used, or restrict invites to specific email domains.

## Tips

- Use invites to grow your community thoughtfully and maintain trust.
- If public registration is enabled, make sure you have clear rules and active moderation.
- Invites can be used for onboarding new members, organizing private groups, or launching new circles.
