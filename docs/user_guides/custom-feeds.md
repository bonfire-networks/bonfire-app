# Custom Feeds & Filters

Bonfire gives you powerful tools to customize your experience and control what you see in your navigation controls and in feeds and timelines.

## Sidebar Feeds

You can choose which feeds appear in your navigation section for quick access:
- **Presets:** Following, Local, Articles, Bookmarks, Explore, Likes, and more.
- **Circles:** Your custom circles (groups of people) are also shown as feeds for easy access.

To customize which feeds appear:
1. Click the gear icon next to "Feeds" in the sidebar.
2. Select which preset feeds you want to include.

## Feed Presets

Bonfire offers several built-in feed types:
- **Following:** Posts from people you follow.
- **Local:** Activities from your instance.
- **Remote:** Activities from other federated instances.
- **Explore:** Activities from your instance and federated instances.
- **Events, Articles, Audio, Images, Bookmarks, etc.:** Specialized feeds for different content types.

You can enable or disable any of these in your sidebar.

## Custom Feeds

You can create your own custom feeds by filtering:
- By circles (e.g. only posts from "Bonfire Team" or "Around the bonfire")
- By content types (e.g. only images, only articles, only events)
- By activity types (e.g. only boosts, only replies)
- By time range, local/remote, and more

You can also change the sort order (chronological, or by most boosted or liked or replied).

To create a custom feed:
1. Open the feed filter/settings panel (usually via the filter icon or "custom feed" button at the top of feeds).
2. Adjust filters for circles, types, and other criteria.
3. Save your custom feed for quick access in the sidebar.

## Tips

- Use circles to create focused feeds for different projects, aspects of your life, or interests.
- Hide or show specific types of content to reduce noise.
- Save multiple custom feeds for different contexts (e.g. "Work", "Friends", "Events").
