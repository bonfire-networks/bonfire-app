# Moderator Tools

Bonfire provides moderators with tools to help keep communities safe, welcoming, and aligned with their values.

## Reviewing Flags

- Moderators can view flagged posts and accounts from the **Flags** section in the sidebar.
- Each flag includes details about the reported content, who flagged it, and the reason.
- Review the flag, discuss with other moderators if needed, and decide on appropriate action.

## Actions Moderators Can Take

When reviewing a flag, youâ€™ll see options such as:

- **Mediate:** Start a mediation process by messaging the original author or the flagger.
- **Take action:** Open a menu with moderation actions:
    - Hide this post (for all users of your instance)
    - Delete post
    - Block the original author (for all users of your instance)
    - Unflag
    - Block the flagger (eg. in case of abusive flagging)

<!-- TODO: - Moderators can leave notes on flags and share context with other moderators. -->

## Tips

- Review flags promptly to maintain trust and safety.
- Use moderation actions thoughtfully and document decisions.
- Collaborate with other moderators for consistency.
