# Choosing a Bonfire Instance

Bonfire is decentralized: anyone can run their own instance, and each instance can have its own rules, features, and community focus. When you join Bonfire, you choose which instance to sign up on—similar to picking an email provider.

## What should I consider when choosing an instance?

- **Community and Culture:** Each instance may have its own theme, language, moderation style, or community guidelines. Choose one that matches your interests and values.
- **Rules and Moderation:** Review the instance’s code of conduct and moderation policies. Some are open to everyone, others are invite-only or focused on specific topics.
- **Features and Extensions:** Instance admins can enable or disable Bonfire extensions (like groups, boundaries, or custom moderation tools). If you want a specific feature, check if the instance supports it.
- **Performance and Uptime:** Larger or well-maintained instances may offer better reliability, but smaller ones can offer a more close-knit community.
- **Privacy:** Some instances may have stricter privacy settings or data retention policies.

## Can I move later?

Yes! Bonfire supports account migration and data portability. You can export your data and move to another instance if your needs change.

## How do I find an instance?

- Ask friends or communities you trust for recommendations.
- Look for public directories or lists of Bonfire instances (coming soon).
- Or, you can always start your own!

Once you’ve chosen an instance, your username will look like `@yourname@yourinstance.tld`. You can interact with users across the entire fediverse, no matter which instance you’re on.
