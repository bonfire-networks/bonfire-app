# Messaging

Bonfire includes a built-in messaging system for direct conversations—both one-on-one and in groups.

> **Warning:**  
> Messages are **not currently end-to-end encrypted**. While they are private to participants, administrators of your instance (and remote instances, for federated messages) may be able to access message contents. For sensitive or confidential information, please use a secure messaging app such as Signal.

## Accessing Messages

- Click **Direct Messages** in the navigation bar to open your inbox.
- Your inbox shows conversations, with tabs for "All", "Followed only", and "Other" to help you filter messages.

## Starting a New Conversation

- Click the **New message** button at the top of the messages panel.
- Search for and select one or more recipients (you can start group conversations).
- Compose your message and send.

## Conversation Features

- View all your conversations in the left panel; select one to see the full thread.
- Messages are threaded, so you can reply to specific messages within a conversation.
- Sort messages by newest or oldest reply first.
- See participant avatars and activity at a glance.

## Privacy and Boundaries

- Messages are private and only visible to participants.
<!-- 
- You can control who can message you via your profile or account privacy settings. 
-->
- If you receive unwanted messages, you can silence or block the sender (see [Blocking & Moderation Tools](./moderation.md)).

## Tips

- Use group messages for project teams, event planning, or private discussions.
- You can message any user on your instance or, if federation is enabled, users on other compatible fediverse platforms that support direct messaging.
- Keep conversations respectful and follow your instance’s code of conduct.
