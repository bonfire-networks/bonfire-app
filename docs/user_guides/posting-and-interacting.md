# Posting, Sharing, and Interacting

Bonfire supports a range of ways to share updates, media, and interact with others—both locally and across the fediverse.

## Creating a Post

- Click the **Compose** button (usually on the bottom right of your screen) to start a new post.
- Choose which profile you want to post from.
- Write your message, including hashtags, mentions, or attaching media.
- You can use **Markdown** for formatting with bold/italics, or adding headings, lists, links, images, and more.
- Set privacy and sharing options (e.g. public, local-only, boundaries, specific circles or people, etc).
- Optionally, add a content warning and/or mark it as sensitive.

### Post Controls

At the bottom of the compose box, you'll find buttons for:
- **Attach**: Add images, videos, audio, or files to your post.
- **Emoji**: Insert emojis.
- **Sensitive**: Mark your post or media as sensitive.
- **Summary**: Add a summary. If you marked the post as sensitive, this will also be used as a content warning to hide the main content (text and media) behind a warning label.
- **Title**: Add a title to your post (useful for long-form articles).

## Interacting with Posts

- **Reply:** Respond to any post to start or join a conversation.
- **Boost:** Share someone else's post with your followers (if allowed by privacy settings).
- **Like:** Tell the poster that you enjoyed their post, and add it to your favourites list.
- **Bookmark:** Privately save a post for later.
- **Share to Circles:** Share posts with specific circles or groups.

## Mentions and Hashtags

- Mention other users by typing `@username@domain.tld`.
- Use hashtags (e.g. `#bonfire`) to make posts discoverable and join conversations.

### Hashtags

You can use one or more hashtags in your post to indicate subject matter and group your post with others using the same hashtag, aiding discoverability.   Hashtags work like most social media: just add a `#` before the word (e.g. `#Introduction`). 

Hashtags are case-insensitive, so `#Introduction` and `#introduction` are treated the same. For accessibility, use upper camel case (capitalize the first letter of each word), e.g. `#ThisIsAHashtag`.

You can include as many hashtags as you like, each up to 100 characters.  
To end a hashtag, use a space. For example, in `this #soup rules`, only `#soup` is the hashtag.

## Attachments

- Attach images, videos, or files to your post. For details, see [Attachments and Media](./attachments-and-media.md).

## Privacy and Boundaries

- Choose who can see or interact with your post using boundaries and circles.
- For details, see [Privacy & Sharing Controls: Circles & Boundaries](/docs/user_guides/boundaries.md).

## Tips

- You can post from any of your profiles—each with its own identity and privacy settings.
- Use circles and boundaries to tailor the audience for each post.
- Explore content warnings and sensitive media options for respectful sharing.
