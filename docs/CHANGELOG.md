## Bonfire Social [1.0-rc.3 (2025-10-2)]

### ✨ What’s new and improved?

- **Consent-based quoting (FEP-044f):** Bonfire now supports consent-based quoting, introduced through the new ActivityPub extension [FEP-044f](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/044f/fep-044f.md). With this first iteration released alongside Mastodon’s, it marks an important step toward making quoting work smoothly — and respectfully — across the fediverse.

![quote](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJrbEX_hll.png)

With Bonfire, you can now:
- Use boundaries to define who can quote your post, who must request first, or who cannot request at all.
- Quote — or request consent to quote — someone else’s post.
- Give or withdraw consent at any time.

![quote2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkVVEQuhgg.jpg)

- **Import your old posts when moving instances:** You can now bring your posts (and optionally their replies) with you when moving to Bonfire from another instance. Imported posts keep their original dates and links, and are added to your timeline in the right order, so your history looks complete. Replies and threads are preserved, as are like/boost counts. This works by automatically "boosting" your old posts (but without flooding people's feeds or notifications with old activities).

- **Other data portability improvements:** Instance migration is now more robust. In addition to follows, blocks, and posts, you can now export and import circles/lists, bookmarks, likes, and boosts. A dedicated dashboard helps you follow the progress of data imports and migrations, so you always know what's happening with your data.

- **Federation status dashboard:** Similarly, you can now easily track your outgoing and incoming federated activities with a new dashboard, making it simpler to monitor federation health and troubleshoot issues.

![fedstatus](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B17TH7_nel.jpg)

- **RSS/Atom feeds:** Access your data beyond the fediverse: Subscribe to Bonfire feeds via your preferred RSS/Atom client. You can subscribe to specific users or to a feed of your choice, including bookmarks, likes, etc, all available as RSS.

- **Boundary UI & usability improvements:** Boundaries (who can see or interact with your posts) are now easier to use. For example, you can share a post publicly but limit who can reply or quote it. Bonfire’s boundaries now also connect with GoToSocial’s interaction controls and Mastodon's quote authorisations, making them more interoperable across the fediverse. We also drafted a guide about [how you can start using circles and boundaries](https://docs.bonfirenetworks.org/boundaries.html) (feedback welcome!)

![boundary](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByzTmMnhel.jpg)

- **Mobile web app improvements**: The progressive web app experience has been refined with UI and UX enhancements that make Bonfire feel more native on mobile devices. Whether you're installing Bonfire to your home screen or using it directly in your mobile browser, the interface now responds more smoothly and adapts better to different screen sizes.

![pwa](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyXfo29nll.jpg)

- **Links in posts:** Remote posts now get the same rich URL previews as local ones.

- **Single sign-on**: Bonfire supports OpenID Connect and OAuth2 authentication, allowing instance administrators to configure their preferred identity providers for login and signup. We've tested integration with GitHub, ORCID, Zenodo, and more, making it easier for communities to align authentication with their existing workflows and trust networks. Each instance can define which providers to enable and whether to allow new signups through SSO, giving administrators flexibility in how their communities access Bonfire. Bonfire can also act as an SSO provider itself, so other applications can authenticate users through your instance.  

- **Federation interoperability guide:** Published [interoperability docs](https://docs.bonfirenetworks.org/federation-interoperability.html) to ensure compatibility with other ActivityPub software.

- **User guides:** [New guides](https://docs.bonfirenetworks.org/user-guides.html) and documentation help you get started and make the most of Bonfire's features, whether you're new to the fediverse or exploring advanced capabilities like boundaries and circles. This is a work in progress, so feedback on how things would be better explained or what's missing would be very helpful! These guides are designed to help you understand, use, and configure Bonfire.

## Bonfire Social [1.0-rc.2 (2025-07-08)]

### ✨ What’s new and improved?

- **Long-form publishing:** Going beyond beyond short posts to [read and write in-depth articles](https://bonfire.cafe/post/01JYRX7HCGME693BGCZF6AGGK1), ideal for essays, announcements, or detailed content. Article feeds are now available for RSS readers.
- **Smarter feeds:** New feed options for **events**, **books**, and **articles** help you discover what matters to you most. You can now also filter out your own activities from your feeds when desired.
- **Multi-profiles overview**: A new navigation menu can display all your profiles with notification indicators, allowing quick profile switching.
- **Private by default:** New Bonfire instances start as invite-only, giving admins control over membership from day one.
- **Interface improvements:** We've refined the user experience, enhanced notifications and ensured posts display properly across mobile devices.
- **More reliable:** Tons of fixes for authentication, media uploads, mentions, moderation, and other core features.

Additional improvements include:

- Better translation and localization workflow
- Smoother OAuth/OpenID login and SSO support
- Updated documentation and guides for admins and contributors
- Enhanced S3 integration for uploads
- Lots of small bug fixes on comment threads, messaging, settings, and more
