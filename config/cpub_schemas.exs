# This tells `Pointers.Tables` which apps to search for tables to
# index. If you add another dependency with Pointables, you will want
# to add it to the search path

## WARNING: This is the flaky magic bit. We use configuration to
## compile extra stuff into modules.  If you add new fields or
## relations to ecto models in a dependency, you must recompile that
## dependency for it to show up! You will probably find you need to
## `rm -Rf _build/*/lib/cpub_*` a lot.

## Note: This does not apply to configuration for
## `Pointers.Changesets`, which is read at runtime, not compile time
